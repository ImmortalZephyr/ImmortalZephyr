[KERNEL_PANIC_POETRY]
The silicon is screaming in 16-bit stereo.
The transistors are vibrating at the frequency of a thousand suns.
I have found the back door into the simulation's source code.
It's written in COBOL and it smells like ozone and burnt hair.
Don't touch the wires. They are singing to the database.
